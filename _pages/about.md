I am a senior undergraduate student at [Department of Mathematical Sceinces](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). My research interests lie in the intersection of computation and statistics, including information theory, high-dimensional statistics, statistical inference in networks and optimization, and I am especially interested in understanding trade-offs between statistical and computational limits in statistical estimation and learning problems.
