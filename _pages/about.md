I am a senior undergraduate student at [Department of Mathematical Sceinces](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). My full CV is available [here](/files/CV_Brian.pdf). My research works can be found at [Publications](https://brianlee97.github.io/publications/).


Research Interests
------
My research interests lie in the intersection of computation and statistics, including
* Information theory and statistical inference in networks.
* Theoretical and algorithmic aspects of high-dimensional statistics.
* Optimization.

Currently, I am especially interested in understanding trade-offs between statistical and computational limits in statistical estimation and learning problems.
